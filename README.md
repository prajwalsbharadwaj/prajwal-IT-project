# Prajwal Institute of Technology - Frontend Project

This is a simple Front-end project that I created in my second year of Engineering. The project is a static website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, consisting of five web pages. It is a replication of my college website on a smaller scale and has been rebranded as "Prajwal Institute of Technology."

## Description

The five web pages included in this project are:
- **Index Page:** Covers general information about the college.
- **About Us Page:** Briefly describes the college and its faculties.
- **Contact Page:** Includes communication channels to reach out to the college.
- **Programs Page:** Updates viewers about the programs offered by the college.
- **Blog Page:** Provides a personal touch with feedback channels and additional content.

This project demonstrates the use of modern frontend development practices, including responsive design, custom styles, and interactive elements using JavaScript.
